## Technologies
For the development of this project, I have used React, and Redux. I also used Ruby on Rails for the development of the [backend project](https://github.com/Behnam1369/homestretch-api) and api endpoints. Some other tools like Git, Github, Figma, Postman, Trello, etc are also used in this project.
